# ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Ayush Negi
A full-stack LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) web developer with experience in creating websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP. In database management, I have knowledge of MySQL. Moreover, I am proficient in Python and its frameworks, as well as C and C++. Additionally, I excel in creating responsive UI/UX for both applications and websites.

As a full-stack LAMP web developer, I bring a versatile skill set to the table. My expertise lies in crafting visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Proficient in jQuery, I enhance the user experience with dynamic and interactive elements on the client side.

On the back end, I command the LAMP stackâ€”Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHPâ€”to develop robust and scalable server-side applications. My proficiency in PHP facilitates the creation of dynamic and feature-rich web applications, ensuring seamless communication between front-end and back-end components.

With a strong foundation in MySQL, I design efficient and secure database structures, optimizing data storage and retrieval. Beyond web development, I extend my capabilities to Python and its frameworks for tasks like data analysis and automation. Proficiency in C and C++ enables me to contribute to diverse programming challenges.

I take pride in creating responsive UI/UX designs, prioritizing a seamless user experience across devices. Committed to continuous learning, I stay abreast of the latest trends, ensuring adaptability and relevance in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
